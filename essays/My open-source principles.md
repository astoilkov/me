# My open-source principles

These are set of principles that I follow in all my open-source repos. Their main goal is to ensure **quality**.

- **The best or nothing.** If my repo isn't the best for the job I will write the better one at the top of the README
- **Used in production.** Every repo I open-source is used in one of these apps:
    - [Modern writing app designed for local Markdown files](https://nota.md)
    - [The internet at your fingertips](https://historie.app)
    - [Markdown Editor for Mac / Windows / Linux](https://caret.io)
- **Maintenance.** If I wrote it I will maintain it. This is because:
    - I personally use my repos
    - I respect open-source
    - I am very consciences
    - I aim for high quality
- **No bloat.** I am inspired by [@sindresorhus](https://sindresorhus.com/) and I aim to create small and focused modules
- **TypeScript.** Every repo is written in TypeScript with all strict `tsconfig` options enabled
- **Learn from the code.** You can expect comments in the source-code answering the "Why?" questions in your head
- **Trying to help you choose.** README has "Alternatives" section listing similar modules
- **Strict ESLint.** (coming soon) I have a very strict ESLint rule set which I will include in all my open-source repos.

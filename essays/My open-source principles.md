# My open-source principles

These are set of principles that I follow in all my open-source repos. Their main goal is to ensure **quality**.

- **The best or ...** If my repo isn't the best alternative I will write the better one at the top of the README
- **Reliable**:
    - TypeScript with all strict options enabled, including `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`
    - ESLint super strict rules. Using [eslint-config-strictest](https://github.com/astoilkov/eslint-config-strictest).
    - Test for every bug. 100% test coverage.
- **Used in production.** Every repo I open-source is used in one of these apps:
    - [Modern writing app designed for local Markdown files](https://nota.md)
    - [The internet at your fingertips](https://historie.app)
    - [Markdown Editor for Mac / Windows / Linux](https://caret.io)
- **Fast responses.** Response in 24 hours (holidays and personal issues are an exception)
- **No bloat.** I am inspired by [@sindresorhus](https://sindresorhus.com/) and I aim to create small and focused modules
- **Learn from the code.** Comments in the source-code answering the "Why?" questions in your head
- **Trying to help you choose.** README has "Alternatives" section listing similar modules

## Motivation

Code is both beautiful and practical. I want to show the beauty of small, fast, reliable, and understandable code.

I sometimes as a developer feel lonely. I want to talk about beautiful and smart code with others. I hope to connect with such people through my work.
